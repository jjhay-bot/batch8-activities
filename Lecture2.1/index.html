                    <h2>Duterte government programs</h2>
                    <h3>Duterte nationwide campaign to rid the country of crime, and corruption, and illegal drugs.</h3>
                        <p>The Philippine drug war is the anti-drug policy and actions of the Philippine government under President Rodrigo Duterte, who assumed office on June 30, 2016. According to former Philippine National Police Chief and future senator Ronald dela Rosa, the policy is aimed at "the neutralization of illegal drug personalities nationwide".</p>
                        <p>Duterte has urged members of the public to kill criminals and drug addicts. Research by media organizations and human rights groups has shown that police routinely execute unarmed drug suspects and then plant guns and drugs as evidence. Philippine authorities have denied misconduct by police.</s>
                        <p>‚ÄúConstant pa rin kung ano ang kanyang sinimulan. Ganoon pa rin. Walang pagbabago. Patuloy ‚Äòyun. Lahat iyan, walang pagbabago. Paulit-ulit lang sinasabi ni Presidente iyan (Everything that he has started is still constant. It‚Äôs still the same. Nothing has changed. It continues. There are no changes in all that he does. That‚Äôs what the President is repeatedly saying),‚Äù Panelo said Sunday in an interview with dzIQ.</p>

                    <h3>Duterte initiated the massive Build! Build! Build! Projects</h3>
                    <p>The goals of the program are to reduce poverty, encourage economic growth and reduce congestion in Metro Manila. In November 2019, the government revised its list of flagship infrastructure projects under Duterte's "Build, Build, Build" program, expanding it to 100.</p>
                    <p>The ‚ÄúBBB‚Äù program consists of around 20,000 infrastructure projects nationwide, involving roads, highways, farm-to-market roads, airports, seaports, terminals, evacuation centres, lighthouses, hospitals, schools, government centres, and the like. It is the centrepiece and one of the top-priority programs of the Duterte administration, which has been allocated a budget of around PHP 8 trillion (US$164.7 billion) for a six-year period (2017-2022). Such budget allocation on infrastructure is thus far the highest in Philippine history to date.  
                        Over the past six administrations, the country‚Äôs infrastructure spending-to-Gross Domestic Product (GDP) ratio only averaged at 2.6 percent of GDP. To note, from 2001 to 2010, the average percentage of infrastructure budget to GDP was 1.6 percent or PHP 100.3 billion (US$2.06 billion), while from 2011-2016 it was 3.0 percent or PHP 378.3 billion (US$7.7 billion).
                        When Duterte took office in July 2016, his administration reversed this ‚Äúlong-neglect‚Äù in infrastructure investment. To cite, from 2017 to 2019, the average percentage of infrastructure budget to GDP was 6.0 percent or PHP 932 billion (US$19.1 billion). In 2020 the budget allocation for the ‚ÄúBBB‚Äù program was 4.6 percent of GDP or PHP 972.5 billion (US$20 billion).  </p>
