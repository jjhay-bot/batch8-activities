    <h1>  KEEP TO THE STANDARDS</h1>
    <span>Each industry has certain standards, and violating them will be considered bad form. In this case, web development is not an exception, and, therefore, it is not worth reinventing the wheel. It will be a bad idea for at least one reason â€” people are used to these standards, so, they can get lost or feel uncomfortable if something goes beyond the habitual practices.</span>
    <br><br>
    <div>
        <h3>Examples of such standard practices in development are:</h3>
            <ul>Hyperlinks should be sufficiently visible for the user to be able to notice them in the main text.</ul>
            <ul>A company logo should be located in the upper left corner and, when clicked, it should redirect the user to the home page.</ul>
            <ul>Contacts, registration, and authorization buttons should be placed in the upper right corner.</ul></li>
            <ul>Website navigation map should be the same for all pages.</ul>
